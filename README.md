# Aggregating Local Descriptors Into a Compact Image Representation

## Introduction
This repository contains our VLAD (Vector of locally aggregated descriptors) implementations, reports, and experiment results for the mid-term project of Computer Vision (INT3412E 20) in VNU-UET.

## Description
VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) is a method of representing descriptors in the field of image processing and computer vision, commonly used in object recognition and image search applications. It is a descriptor representation technique developed to enhance the performance of recognition systems based on local features of images.
## Requirements
Python >= 3.5

## Installation
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/annguyen3112/Aggregating-Local-Descriptors-Into-a-Compact-Image-Representation.git
cd Aggregating-Local-Descriptors-Into-a-Compact-Image-Representation
